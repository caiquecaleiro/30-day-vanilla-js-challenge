    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Elee';
    console.log(team5, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Elee',
      age: 23
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(captain, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain1 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 10, age: 20 });
    console.log(captain1, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person};
    // console.log(captain3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
